# youtubeSummarizer

In today's fast paced world most of the people find it difficult to take out time for themselves. An informative platform like youtube has proved to be a boon for today's youngsters and everything is available there free of cost. Although viewing videos can be informative but honestly it might become tiresome after sometime. In order to make the whole process of extracting information fast and efficient I propose a project that will summarize the whole content(transcript) of a youtube video(for now) and summarize it in a short-paragraph/group of sentences containing the crucial information transcribed in the whole video. This will ultimately make the process of extracting information alot faster.
