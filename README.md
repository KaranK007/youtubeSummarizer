# youtubeSummarizer

In today's fast paced world most of the people find it difficult to take out time for themselves. An informative platform like youtube has proved to be a boon for today's youngsters and everything is available there free of cost. Although viewing videos can be informative but honestly it might become tiresome after sometime. In order to make the whole process of extracting information fast and efficient I propose a project that will summarize the whole content(transcript) of a youtube video(for now) and summarize it in a short-paragraph/group of sentences containing the crucial information transcribed in the whole video. This will ultimately make the process of extracting information alot faster.

# Project Description

Youtube Video Summarizer proposes to solve the problem of watching tiresome lengthy videos by extracting the transcript of the video (youtube) and performing a summarizing algorithm on it to generate a short paragraph that would contain all the important information contained in the video. A any person can save a lot of time by reading the summary of the video and not watching it. The opportunity is huge as this project can later be scaled to summarize important meetings, sessions, teaching classes, etc.
The problem that this project attempts to solve is saving time by gathering and converting real knowledge into small readable format. The project will extract the information contained in a youtube video and will summarize it in small paragraph without any user input(except for the video's URL). 
The need for the project is clearly visible as in today's world, people rarely get time for activities such as reading and increasing their knowledge. Moreover watching lengthy videos can become boring. Therefore, in order to save time and do all such things in the shortest time possible while keeping the learning part in place, this project will deliver it all.
I plan to develop the project using Flask(python's web framework) for the backend and Html for a simple frontend.
